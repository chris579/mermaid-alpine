Simple, minimal and self updating docker image for Mermaid based on Alpine Linux.  

## Volumes
`/var/lib/mermaid` - working directory, mount your files here  

## Getting started
### Installation
Up-to-date builds are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/chris579/mermaid-alpine). This image is build daily and published if a new version is available.

```
docker pull chris579/mermaid-alpine
```

### Quickstart
```
docker run --name mermaid -v ./data:/var/lib/mermaid chris579/mermaid-alpine
```

or if using docker-compose

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  tor:
    image: chris579/mermaid-alpine
    container_name: tor
    ports:
     - "127.0.0.1:9050:9050"
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime
      - ./data:/var/lib/tor
```

This configuration will expose the SOCKS5 port to your local machine. You should not bind this port to a public network unless you know what you do.

### Advanced configuration
For relay modes the config needs to be adjusted. You can mount your own config file to `/etc/tor/torrc.config`.  

Replace `<yourEmail>` with a contact mail address. In case something is wrong with your node you will be contacted there. You might want to obscure it because it will be displayed and indexed in plain text by search engines.

Replace `<yourNickName>` with a nickname of your choice. You and others will be able to find the node with this name. This is helpful when searching for your node.

#### Bridge configuration
A tor brige is a not publically listed middle relay. It works like a normal middle relay but is especially suitable for situations when public tor relays are blocked in some way by ISPs or governments.

```
ORPort 9001
Nickname <yourNickName>
ContactInfo <yourEmail>
ExitRelay 0
ExitPolicy reject *:*
BridgeRelay 1
```

Make sure to expose port 9001  
`-p 9001:9001`

or if using docker-compose

```yaml
ports:
  - "9001:9001"
```

#### Middle relay
A middle relay is one of the first few relays traffic flows through. Due to the nature of Tor it is considered legally safe to host a middle relay because you are not able to look inside the packages (and therefore can't log them). After some time your relay will also become available as a entry node if it is considered stable. Entry guards are a sensitive point in the Tor network as they are seeing the blank IPs of their users. You can read more about that [here](https://blog.torproject.org/lifecycle-new-relay). Most hosters are agreeing on providing a Tor relay on your server. 

```
ORPort 9001
Nickname <yourNickName>
ContactInfo <yourEmail>
ExitRelay 0
ExitPolicy reject *:*
```

Make sure to expose port 9001  
`-p 9001:9001`

or if using docker-compose

```yaml
ports:
  - "9001:9001"
```

#### Exit relay
An exit relay is the last point where traffic is running through. In exit mode your server will reach out to the internet, forwarding the original request of the user. This also means that law enforcement or ISPs will just see your server accessing these resources. A lot of hosters are prohibiting/blocking exit relays because they fear prosecution. Before running an exit relay make sure to contact your hoster about his opinion to exit relays.

This sample configuration is using a reduced exit policy list. This limits the number of ports that can be used your node as an exit relay.
```
ORPort 9001
Nickname <yourNickName>
ContactInfo <yourEmail>

Make sure to expose port 9001  
`-p 9001:9001`

or if using docker-compose

```yaml
ports:
  - "9001:9001"
```

### Liming the used bandwith
To have control over the bandwith and cpu load you can limit the used bandwith. Add this lines to your config:
```
BandwidthRate 10 Mbits
BandwidthBurst 12 Mbits
MaxAdvertisedBandwidth 9 Mbits
```

`MaxAdvertisedBandwidth` needs to be lower than `BandwidthRate`. It also indirectly limits the cpu load. By adjusting it you can fine tune the load of your server. You can find out more about these parameters (and every other config parameter) [here](https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en).

### Seeing the results
When running in relay or exit mode your tor service should be picked up by the network after a couple of hours. You can then search for your node on [tormetrics](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search) (if it's not running as a bridge). The first days your Tor node will slowly increase traffic. The process how new relays are treated by the Tor network is described in this [blog post](https://blog.torproject.org/lifecycle-new-relay).
